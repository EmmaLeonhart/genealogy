# Geni-blocked campaign laundry list — archive part 2 (2026-09-22)

Continuation of `docs/queue-archive/geni-blocked-campaigns-2026-09.md`.
Do **not** start any of this under the Geni moratorium (≥2026-10-21).
Parked here so `queue.md` stays work-only.

## Forest exports

These are people I want exports on but they are not in the priority in the same way. Often cover possibly underserved people but their significance is unclear

Forest https://www.geni.com/people/NN-Fuca/6000000227739821875

Descendants https://www.geni.com/people/NN/6000000227739695943

## Ancestor Exports

At the end of the queue after all other things are done I want to do some specific ancestor export campaigns. 

Ancestor exports from certain specific people to get their ancestors

try this one https://www.geni.com/people/Reformatorin-Ursula-von-M%C3%BCnsterberg/6000000188494434823?through=6000000003481830064

## `Forest` exports centred on people carrying the TAIL relationships in the TSVs

Ruled 2026-09-13: *"put it at the end of the queue that... to do forest exports centred on people
with the tail relationships for the TSV files."* Written down and not started **yet**.

**Last in order, and it gets done.** Emma, immediately after: *"it's at the very terminal end of
it. And it's NOT parked. It's gonna be addressed later."*

**Why a `Forest` and not a lookup:** a relationship we have never seen in a real Geni export has
no attested representation, and § *no guessing on the representations* forbids composing one.
The export centred on a person who **has** that relationship is what shows how Geni writes it.

**The tail, counted off `paths/harvested-path-geni-*.tsv` on 2026-09-13.** The whole distribution
is 33 distinct strings; these are the ones below the common six and their gender variants:

    134  her adoptive mother        3  her child            2  his/her father
     18  her ex-husband             3  his ex-wife          2  his parent
     15  your relative?             3  his fiancée          2  her ex-partner
     11  his partner                1  his child            1  his adoptive mother
      5  his/her parent             1  her partner          1  his adoptive father
      4  her fiancé

**⛔ THE URGENT ONES ARE THE UNATTESTED ONES, and there are two kinds.**

* **fiancé / fiancée — 7 rows, and `ENGA` occurs ZERO times in this corpus.** There is no shape to
  copy, so they are currently emitted as a couple with no marriage event. This is the case Emma
  described exactly: *"if there's some relationship that is only present in one spot, we have to
  do a `Forest` export on that point in order to get that relationship so we know how to
  represent it."*
* **`your relative?` — 15 rows.** Geni itself is not naming the relationship, so a `Forest` on
  those people is the only way to find out what the link actually is.

**Already attested and needing no export** (`devlog.md` 2026-09-13 carries the measurements):
adoptive → `FAMC` + `2 PEDI adopted` + `1 ADOP` + `3 ADOP BOTH`; ex- → bare `1 MARR` with bare
`1 DIV`; partner → a `FAM` with no `MARR`. `foster` is attested 781 times in the corpus and
appears in **no** path string, so it needs nothing until one turns up.

Pairs with these relations are in `reports/path-chains.tsv`; the person to centre the export on
is the one the tail word describes.

## Names

Remember that this is not something to be done out of order, it is the second last item in the queue for a reason

We are still generating non-name items as names such as numbers, and I think https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/OBender12 is likely pretty pissed at this point, but no talk page messages yet. idk why you did not fix it and seem to have completely overlooked the error that he constantly corrects. There are plenty of non-name things that need to be parsed not as names.

Read "address_this.html"

### Examples

Even in the current batch one exists lol

# und -- family, 8 bearer(s) in the batches
# create a new item
CREATE
#   the item just created: set the en label to "und"
LAST	Len	"und"
#   set the mul label to "und"
LAST	Lmul	"und"
#   set the en description to "family name"
LAST	Den	"family name"
#   P31 instance of = Q101352
LAST	P31	Q101352
#   Q61139384 Mangold von Thurgau und Nellenburg III: P734 family name = the item just created
Q61139384	P734	LAST	S2600	"6000000004106003883"
