## Skills

Workflow behaviors live as skills in `.claude/skills/` (auto-discovered by Claude Code):
`emergency-stop`, `cron-is-local`, `autonomous-loop`, `queue-driven-workflow`,
`writing-style`, `cleanvibe-update-check`. They are vendored into this repo and kept
current by the `cleanvibe-update-check` skill.

- **Last cleanvibe update check:** `2026-07-31` — all six skills present, none
  superseded, nothing refreshed. Note the page's newest entry is **v1.15.0**
  while this repo was scaffolded from **v1.17.0**, so the check can only show
  that nothing *listed* is newer than what is vendored here; whether v1.16 or
  v1.17 changed a skill is not something the page currently answers.

## Project Description

Merge Geni.com GEDCOM exports into one canonical genealogy, then reconcile that
genealogy against Wikidata — and eventually generate the edits that would create
the missing people on Wikidata.

The user's stated direction, in their own framing:

1. Merge the exports into a single tree.
2. Work out the Wikidata connections as far as the data allows, using the Geni
   ID that every record preserves.
3. Later, expand the tree with more exports from Geni — which means finding
   good **branch points** in the genealogy to export from next.
4. Much later, queue up creation of the absent people *on* Wikidata, connected
   to their parents, carrying whatever the genealogy supports: multilingual
   label, English label, Geni ID, sex, and the relationship links. Harder
   pieces they named explicitly: the name/surname *properties*, creating
   Wikidata items for surnames that have none so people can be linked to them,
   and queued edits adding name links to people who already have items.

## Architecture and Conventions

**The Geni profile ID is the primary key for everything.** Geni's export writes
it as the GEDCOM xref (`0 @I6000000087535357291@ INDI`) and repeats it as
`1 RFN geni:6000000087535357291`. Merging is therefore an exact join, never
fuzzy name matching. `genimerge.identity` is the single place that knows this;
`tests/test_gedcom_real_exports.py` asserts it against the real files so a
change in Geni's format fails loudly.

Exactly **four xref prefixes** occur, each bound to one record type: `I` on
`INDI`, `F` on `FAM`, `N` on `NOTE`, `S` on `SUBM` — measured over all **31,477**
xrefs in the five exports, and re-checked against the fifth on 2026-08-02
rather than carried forward. Two of the five carry no `NOTE` records at all, so
an export need not use every letter; the claim is that no *other* letter appears
and no letter spans two record types. `GENI_ID_RE` accepts only
those on purpose: when it accepted any letters, the foreign xref `@NI04461@`
parsed as Geni ID `04461` and would have produced a URL to a stranger's profile.
**`tests/test_gedcom_real_exports.py` asserts this on every run**, per export,
naming the offending prefix and record type if Geni ever adds a fifth — so it
needs no remembering, and a change breaks the suite instead of quietly changing
which profile an ID points at.

**The xref is the merge key; `RFN` is corroboration checked elsewhere.**
`Merger.add_source` deliberately does not call `geni_id_of`, so a contradictory
`RFN` does not stop a merge. The cross-check runs in `inventory`, in `model`,
and over the merged output in `tests/test_merge_real_exports.py`.

**Exports are bounded, but no number here is the bound.** The first three
exports each hit 3836 individuals exactly while sharing only 354 people, so they
are overlapping slices rather than copies — and that identical count read as a
cap. The fourth (2026-08-01) has **3840** and the fifth (2026-08-02) **3844**,
which falsifies it twice over. **3836, 3840, 3844 are evenly spaced and that is
not a step of four** — three observations from three days and three seeds do not
rule out the next export landing anywhere. Do not encode the arithmetic, and do
not describe any of these as a cap Geni enforces.
`genimerge.seeds.GENI_EXPORT_CAP` is **3844**, meaning *largest yet seen*; its
docstring is the long form of this, naming the four explanations that fit the
evidence and committing to none. `tests/test_seeds.py` fails if a future export
exceeds it, so the next one to do so is loud rather than silent — that is how
3840 and 3844 were each caught. Expect to merge many exports over time, and
expect the merge to be re-run rather than hand-edited. See
`reports/inventory.md`.

**The merged tree is two disconnected trees.** The fifth export shares *zero*
people and *zero* families with the other four: it is the Japanese mythological
line, 3844 people rooted at Kunino-tokotachi-no-mikoto, against 12422 in the
Norwegian component. The merge is still correct — disjoint components do not
conflict — but any statement about "the tree" should say which one, and
reaching one from the other needs an export that bridges them, which no export
in hand does. `reports/frontier.md` § Components is the live count.

**An export is named for its style, not its seed — so filenames collide.** Geni
writes `export-<style>.ged`, and `Forest`, `Ancestors` and `BloodTree` are the
styles. The first three exports are all three styles of the *same* seed, Eric
Borsheim `6000000087535357291`, which is also their `SUBM` xref. A second
`Forest` export from a different seed therefore arrives with a filename already
taken. Disambiguate in `data_lake/` by appending the seed's Geni profile ID —
`export-Forest-6000000226977233850.ged` — since the profile ID is this repo's
primary key. The seed is the file's first `INDI` record. This has now happened
twice; `export-Forest-6000000226989731860.ged` is the 2026-08-02 one. Note the
`SUBM` xref is the *account owner*, not the seed, so it cannot be used for this.

**Stdlib only.** `urllib` covers the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint. Add a dependency
only when the stdlib genuinely cannot do the job.

**Layout.** `data_lake/` raw inputs (`*.zip` gitignored, `*.ged` tracked) ·
`src/genimerge/` the package · `reports/` generated reports worth keeping in git
· `out/` generated data, gitignored · `tests/` pytest.

### Wikidata properties and items

All confirmed against live Wikidata via `wbgetentities` on 2026-07-30. On
2026-08-02, P1545 was added and P2600 / P734 / P735 plus **every item ID named
below** — `Q5`, `Q6581097`, `Q6581072`, `Q202444`, `Q12308941`, `Q11879590`,
`Q3409032`, `Q101352`, `Q5727902` — were re-confirmed the same way. Every label
matched. **Do not guess these** — several plausible-looking IDs are something
else entirely (P1288, for instance, is a German literature encyclopedia, not a
genealogy identifier).

**Anything the code can emit belongs in this table, and
`tests/test_wikidata_ids_documented.py` enforces it**: every `P…`/`Q…` string
literal in `src/genimerge/` must appear somewhere in this file, or the suite
fails naming the ID and the line it came from. P1545 was missing for a while
despite `genimerge.namelinks` emitting it, which was harmless only because it
happened to be right — a property outside this table is unguarded whether or not
it is correct.

That test checks an ID is **documented, never that it is correct**. Confirming
one means asking Wikidata, which is network and stays out of the suite, so a
typo added to code and table in the same change still passes. `wbgetentities`
remains the only thing that catches that, and the dates above say when it last
ran.

**Identity and structure**

| ID | label | datatype |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P2600 | Geni.com profile ID | external-id |
| P31 | instance of | item — value `Q5` human |
| P21 | sex or gender | item — `Q6581097` male, `Q6581072` female |
| P22 / P25 | father / mother | item |
| P26 | spouse | item |
| P40 | child | item |
| P3373 | sibling | item |

**Life events**

| ID | label | datatype |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P569 / P570 | date of birth / date of death | time |
| P19 / P20 | place of birth / place of death | item |
| P119 | place of burial | item |
| P2842 | place of marriage | item (qualifier on P26) |
| P106 | occupation | item |
| P97 | noble title | item |
| P535 | Find a Grave memorial ID | external-id |

**Names** — the part of `todo.md` that needs new items created

| ID | label | datatype |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P735 | given name | item — name items are `Q202444` given name, or `Q12308941` male / `Q11879590` female / `Q3409032` unisex given name |
| P734 | family name | item — name items are `Q101352` family name |
| P1950 | second family name in Spanish name | item (not applicable here) |
| P1477 | birth name | monolingual text |
| P1559 | name in native language | monolingual text |
| P1545 | series ordinal | string — **qualifier**, not a claim |

`P1545` is how a person with several given names keeps them in order: each P735
statement carries the ordinal of that name within the full given-name string.
`genimerge.namelinks` emits it (`SERIES_ORDINAL`), and it has not yet appeared
in a generated batch, because no matched person so far has more than one
given-name token. So it is correct-by-confirmation rather than
correct-by-observation — the first batch that includes one is worth reading
closely.

**Date qualifiers** — the GEDCOM modifiers map onto these

| GEDCOM | Wikidata |
| --- | --- |
| `ABT` / `EST` / `CAL` | P1480 sourcing circumstances = `Q5727902` circa |
| `BEF` | P1326 latest date |
| `AFT` | P1319 earliest date |
| `BET x AND y` | P1319 earliest date + P1326 latest date |

**References** — P248 stated in, P854 reference URL, P813 retrieved,
P143 imported from Wikimedia project.

### Cost: this repo is private, so CI is manual-only

**Never add a `push:` or `pull_request:` trigger to `.github/workflows/`.**
Actions minutes are free on public repos but billable on private ones once the
monthly allowance is used, and a surprise bill is not worth a green tick.
`ci.yml` is `workflow_dispatch:` only, and the workflow is disabled at the
GitHub end as well.

Verification therefore happens **locally, before pushing**: `python -m pytest`.
The suite is fast, needs only pytest, and covers the real 24 MB exports. The one
thing local runs cannot do is the Python version matrix — `tests/test_python_floor.py`
is a partial stand-in for that, and says so.

### Working on Windows here

- Commit with `git commit -F <msgfile>`, not `-m` with a here-string: PowerShell
  5.1 mangles `<` and `>` in native-command arguments even inside quotes.
- Never edit UTF-8 text files with `Get-Content -Raw` + `Set-Content` — it
  double-encodes non-ASCII. Use the editing tools, or Python with an explicit
  `encoding="utf-8"`.

## Long command series run in strict order
When the user gives a long series of commands, treat it as a long series of commands to be
executed in relatively STRICT ORDER, one after another, EVEN IF the order seems not to make
sense or seems inefficient. The sequencing is intentional — the user organizes the steps so
states change in the order they want. Do not reorder, merge, or skip steps.

## Not-done taxonomy (never "deliberately deferred")
When work is NOT done, tag it with exactly ONE of: **NEEDS-DECISION** (name the decision +
who decides), **BLOCKED-ON-USER-ACTION** (a real-world action only the user can take — name
it), **BLOCKED-ON-EXTERNAL** (CI / a remote / a third party / another session's unpushed
commit — name it + the unblock signal), **NEEDS-INVESTIGATION** (not understood yet — a
to-do for the next tick, never a resting place), **UNSAFE-TO-GUESS** (could cause damage —
name the risk + what makes it safe), or **OUT-OF-SCOPE** (another repo's job — name it).
LOAD-BEARING DEFAULT: if it fits none of these with a specifically-named blocker, it is NOT
deferred — DO IT NOW. Bare "deliberately not done" / "blocked on <person>" is banned.
