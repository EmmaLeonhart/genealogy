## Skills

Workflow behaviors live as skills in `.claude/skills/` (auto-discovered by Claude Code):
`emergency-stop`, `cron-is-local`, `autonomous-loop`, `queue-driven-workflow`,
`writing-style`, `cleanvibe-update-check`. They are vendored into this repo and kept
current by the `cleanvibe-update-check` skill.

- **Last cleanvibe update check:** `never`

## Project Description

Merge Geni.com GEDCOM exports into one canonical genealogy, then reconcile that
genealogy against Wikidata — and eventually generate the edits that would create
the missing people on Wikidata.

The user's stated direction, in their own framing:

1. Merge the exports into a single tree.
2. Work out the Wikidata connections as far as the data allows, using the Geni
   ID that every record preserves.
3. Later, expand the tree with more exports (from Geni, and from Jenny) — which
   means finding good **branch points** in the genealogy to export from next.
4. Much later, queue up creation of the absent people *on* Wikidata, connected
   to their parents, carrying whatever the genealogy supports: multilingual
   label, English label, Geni ID, sex, and the relationship links. Harder
   pieces they named explicitly: the name/surname *properties*, creating
   Wikidata items for surnames that have none so people can be linked to them,
   and queued edits adding name links to people who already have items.

## Architecture and Conventions

**The Geni profile ID is the primary key for everything.** Geni's export writes
it as the GEDCOM xref (`0 @I6000000087535357291@ INDI`) and repeats it as
`1 RFN geni:6000000087535357291`. Merging is therefore an exact join, never
fuzzy name matching. `genimerge.identity` is the single place that knows this;
`tests/test_gedcom_real_exports.py` asserts it against the real files so a
change in Geni's format fails loudly.

**Exports are capped at 3836 individuals.** All three exports hit that number
exactly while sharing only 354 people, so they are overlapping slices, not
copies. Expect to merge many exports over time, and expect the merge to be
re-run rather than hand-edited. See `reports/inventory.md`.

**Stdlib only.** `urllib` covers the Wikidata SPARQL endpoint. Add a dependency
only when the stdlib genuinely cannot do the job.

**Layout.** `data_lake/` raw inputs (`*.zip` gitignored, `*.ged` tracked) ·
`src/genimerge/` the package · `reports/` generated reports worth keeping in git
· `out/` generated data, gitignored · `tests/` pytest.

### Wikidata properties

Confirmed against live Wikidata; do not guess these.

| property | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| P2600 | Geni.com profile ID |

### Working on Windows here

- Commit with `git commit -F <msgfile>`, not `-m` with a here-string: PowerShell
  5.1 mangles `<` and `>` in native-command arguments even inside quotes.
- Never edit UTF-8 text files with `Get-Content -Raw` + `Set-Content` — it
  double-encodes non-ASCII. Use the editing tools, or Python with an explicit
  `encoding="utf-8"`.

## Long command series run in strict order
When the user gives a long series of commands, treat it as a long series of commands to be
executed in relatively STRICT ORDER, one after another, EVEN IF the order seems not to make
sense or seems inefficient. The sequencing is intentional — the user organizes the steps so
states change in the order they want. Do not reorder, merge, or skip steps.

## Not-done taxonomy (never "deliberately deferred")
When work is NOT done, tag it with exactly ONE of: **NEEDS-DECISION** (name the decision +
who decides), **BLOCKED-ON-USER-ACTION** (a real-world action only the user can take — name
it), **BLOCKED-ON-EXTERNAL** (CI / a remote / a third party / another session's unpushed
commit — name it + the unblock signal), **NEEDS-INVESTIGATION** (not understood yet — a
to-do for the next tick, never a resting place), **UNSAFE-TO-GUESS** (could cause damage —
name the risk + what makes it safe), or **OUT-OF-SCOPE** (another repo's job — name it).
LOAD-BEARING DEFAULT: if it fits none of these with a specifically-named blocker, it is NOT
deferred — DO IT NOW. Bare "deliberately not done" / "blocked on <person>" is banned.
